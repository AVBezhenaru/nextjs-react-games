<strong>3. COPYRIGHT</strong>
The Fonts are protected by United States and international copyright and other laws and treaties. The copyright holder is the sole, exclusive owner of all intellectual property rights, including rights under copyright and trademark law. Licensee agrees not to use the Fonts in any manner that infringes the intellectual property rights of the copyright holder or violates the terms of this EULA. Licensee will be held legally responsible, and indemnifies Licensor, for any infringements on the copyright holder’s rights caused by failure to abide by the terms of this EULA.

<strong>4. TERMINATION</strong>
This EULA is effective until terminated. If Licensee fails to comply with any term of this EULA, Licensor may terminate the EULA with 30 days notice.

<strong>6. WARRANTY</strong>
The Fonts are provided “as is.” Licensor makes no warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Licensor shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages (including damages from loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, and the like) arising out of the use of or inability to use the product even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Because some U.S. states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.

<strong>8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong>
This EULA, in conjunction with the Receipt that accompanies each Font licensed from Licensor, constitutes the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee.
